# US-Debt-Project
For this project I answered 3 questions regarding the United State's public and governemental debt.

I owe a lot to Alex Freburg for creating the [excel course](https://www.analystbuilder.com/courses/excel-for-data-analytics) on analyst builder that helped me make this project and develope my skills as a aspireing data analyst.

After cleaning and manipulatng the data these are the visualizations I made. Click [here](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/US-Debt-Project/blob/main/US%20Debt%20Project.xlsx) to see the real sheets where my raw and cleaned data, pivot tables and in depth written conclusions are.
